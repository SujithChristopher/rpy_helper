This is a Rust timer library. It acts as a replacement for Python's `time.time()` and `datetime.now()` and similar functions.

To use it, you need to install the following:

```
pip install https://github.com/SujithChristopher/rpy_helper/archive/refs/tags/master.tar.gz
```

To use it in python
```
from rpy_helper import rtime

print(rtime())
```
